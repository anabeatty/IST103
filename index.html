          Dancing is one of the best ways to express joy, unite entire communities
          and feel that there, in dance, is possible for harmony. From north to
          south, from east to west of Brazil, the dance is <br />present in its
          different forms, such as <span style="color: crimson">carimbó</span>, a
          typical dance from the northern region of the country.
        </p>
        <p>
          Originating in the state of Pará, the
          <span style="color: crimson">carimbó</span> was born from the farmers'
          desire to dance, who as soon as they finished work at the end of the
          day, danced to the sound of the curimbó, the <br />main instrument of
          Pará dance.
        </p>
        <p>
          The name <span style="color: crimson">carimbó</span>, or curimbó, comes
          from Tupi language, where curi means stick and m’bó means holed, which
          in Portuguese means “stick that produces the sound”. The curimbó
          <br />instrument, whose name is similar to the name of the dance, is
          played with the legs that embrace it to produce sound.
        </p>
        <p>
          The typical dance from northeastern Pará, as well as other types of
          Brazilian dances, received indigenous, African and European influence.
          The mixture then made the <span style="color: crimson">carimbó</span>,
          also called <br />Samba de roda do Marajó or Pau e Corda, one of the
          main artistic representations of the people of Pará.

        <h2>Origin of the Carimbó</h2>
        <p>
          In short, in addition to dance and rhythm, carimbó also constitutes an
          identity. In this sense, with the mixture of various peoples, it is
          possible to perceive the heritage of black people in <br>the dancing, which
          is also present in the fast drumming of the banjo sound. With European
          influence, the typical dance of Pará includes the flute, saxophone and
          clarinet, in addition to the <br>formation of couples, who twirl according
          to the sound of the carimbó. This reference even came from Portuguese
          colonization.
        </p>
        <img src="images/003.jpg.webp" />
        <p>
          Despite the various references, it is not possible to say exactly where
          the carimbó was actually born. However, some historians, such as
          Agripino da Conceição, claim that the origin <br>of the dance came from
          Marapanim, more specifically in the community of Maranhãozinho. In fact,
          the Marapanim region is where you can find most groups that cultivate
          the tradition <br>of typical Pará dance. There, too, is where the “Carimbó
          de Marapanim Festival” takes place every year.
        </p>
        <p>
          Furthermore, it is also believed that the carimbó do Pará is a typical
          dance that was brought to Brazil by African slaves. Over the years, the
          dance would have incorporated influences <br>from other peoples, such as
          indigenous people and Europeans. Thus, the custom of dancing would have
          arisen from the habit of farmers and fishermen, whenever they finished
          working, <br>getting together in groups to dance to the rhythm of the
          curimbó drum.

        <h2>Types of Carimbó</h2>
        <p>
          At the beginning of the dance manifestation, as the state of Pará is
          very large, the carimbó was divided into three groups: carimbó praieiro,
          carimbó pastoral and carimbó rural. In addition <br>to the division
          according to the state's regions, two stamp currents were also adopted:
          the traditional and the modern style. Thus, in the traditional style,
          the musical structure referring to <br>Marapaniense was maintained and its
          main representative is the singer Verequete. On the other hand, the
          modern style has a structure that mixes more modern concepts of rhythm,
          being <br>represented by the singer Pinduca.
        </p>
        <img src="images/004.jpg.webp">
        <p>
          At the time when the rhythm was divided into two currents, there was an
          intense rivalry between those who defended tradition and modernity.
          However, the styles that make up the <br>carimbó vary depending on the type
          of activity performed in each region of Pará. Thus, the main difference
          between the rhythms is in the rhymes that make up the carimbó.

        <h3>Characteristics of the dance</h3>
        <p>
          Carimbó is a dance that brings together happy people, who dance without
          costumes and like to feel their bare feet on the dirt floor. The
          costumes and choreography are certainly the <br>characteristics that most
          distinguish carimbó dancers, as well as the type of playing of the
          instruments and drums. To produce the sound of typical Pará dance,
          instruments cannot be <br>missing. The main ones used are two drums,
          accompanied by a flute, the reco-reco, the banjo, the ganzá and a
          tambourine.
        </p>

        <p>
          In the dance, women decorate their heads with flowers, and wear plenty
          of accessories around their necks and wrists, which make a sound to the
          rhythm of the drum. Furthermore, <br>women still wear very colorful and
          voluminous skirts, which give the feeling of a lot of movement when
          dancing. Men, on the other hand, wear white pants, usually with
          rolled-up hems, <br>a legacy inherited from their black ancestors, who
          rolled up the hems of their pants to work on large mills. It is also the
          men who start the choreography and invite their partners to join <br>the
          dance, to the sound of clapping.
        </p>
        <p>
          Over time, the carimbó gained a lot of notoriety in other regions of
          Brazil, being linked to various religious celebrations. One of the
          celebrations is the party that takes place every <br>year in the
          municipality of Bragança, in honor of Santo Benedito. In this sense, due
          to its connection with religious festivities, the carimbó received, in
          2014, the title of Intangible <br>Cultural Heritage of Brazil.

        <h3>Prominent carimbó artists and recognition</h3>
        <p>In summary, carimbó is a typical dance from the northeast of Pará, but which was spread to other regions of Brazil through various artists, such as the band Calypso. In addition to <br>the band, it is also possible to highlight other artists who contributed to the spread of dance across Brazilian states, for example:
          </p>
          <p>
              Pinduca from the group “Pinduca e banda” (Belém);<br>
              Aroldo from the group “Revelação do Zimba (Salinópolis);<br>
              Ticó from the group “Quentes da Madrugada” (Santarém Novo);<br>
              Lico from the group “Beija-Flor” (Vigia);<br>
              Moacir from the “Filhos de Maiandeua” Group (Maracanã);<br>
              Mário from the group “Japiim” (Marapanim);<br>
              Elias from the group “Raios de Luz” (Curuçá);<br>
              Verequete and Manoel from the group “O Uirapurí” (Belém);<br>
              Amélia from the group “Cruzeirinho” (Soure/Marajó);<br>
              Bigica from the group “Sereia do Mar” (Marapanim).
          </p>

          <p>
              In summary, Carimbó Municipal Day is celebrated in Pará, on August 26th. The date was chosen in honor of the birth date of Mestre Verequete, a musician known as the <br><em>King of Carimbó</em>. In 2014, due to the popularization of the Pará dance, the carimbó was declared an Intangible Cultural Heritage of Brazil by the Cultural Heritage Advisory Council. <br>The decision, at the time, was unanimous. Finally, a year later, in 2015, the typical dance of Pará received the title of Cultural Heritage of Brazil from the National Historical and <br>Artistic Heritage Institute (IPHAN).</p>
